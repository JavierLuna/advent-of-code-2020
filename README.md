# Advent of code 2020

Here's my 2020 attempt at AOC. I will try to do this daily but I will not sweat it if I cannot do it one day.

I will be doing the solutions in Python 3.8+ because I miss it so much :(

## The AOC Framework

Every solution follows nearly the same structure:

* One solution with two parts
* Nearly always the same file shared between the two
* Nearly always the file is composed by lines of numbers
* Solution of part 1 could be used by part 2

I created a small framework to help with the development of AOC solutions, so I don't have to always code the same boilerplate

### How to run solutions

Execute `python3 run.py` to run all solutions using my runner. Use Python 3.8+.
